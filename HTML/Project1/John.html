<p>Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Jon Arbuckle.</u> I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie,Indiana.  I am a proud owner 
    of a cat named Garfield and a dog Named Odie.  Garfield is fat, lazy and loved to eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain.  Although my
    pets drive me <i>crazy</i>, I can't imagine life without them. </p>
<p>I spend about half of my time going to the grosery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield.  I have to make sure to buy all of 
    Garfield's favorite food, or else he will get grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips,pasta
with marinara sauce, frozen pizzas, and <b>lots and lots of lasanga.</b>  When I come home, Garfield usually attackes me and tries to eat 
everything in the grocery bag before I even have a chance to put it in the refrigerator.  One time he ate everything that I bought in 30
seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy more food.  <i>I wasn't too happy about that.</i>  </p>
