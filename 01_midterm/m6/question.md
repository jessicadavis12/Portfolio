### Answer:
14, 3*4+2  the return calls another fucniton so it can't return the function until a return doens't call another funciton. 
Normally the return stops unless nested- but can also be used for a callback funcion


Correct - 2pts - Even though this looks like an odd way of invoking functions, it is valid. What we were looking for was the understanding of precedence and what values are passed to which variables. You got it.  :)
