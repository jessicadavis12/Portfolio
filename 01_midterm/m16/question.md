### The correct way to see a git repository's commit history is (select all correct answers)

1. `git history`
2. `git log`
3. `git commits`
4. `git status`


### Answer:2, 4

Partially correct - 1pt - it is actually just 'git log' that shows you the history.
'git status' does not tell you the history of your repo but rather where you are in the process.
