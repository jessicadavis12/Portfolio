### Question:

What are various iterator functions available in JavaScript (e.g. forEach)?  What would be your choice of an iterator function to loop over the elements of an object?  What would be your choice of an iterator for arrays? Provide simple examples with your brief comments?


Object: can be acessed throught object.entries() or if the keys are needed then object.keys() 


Array:  array.forEach() calls a function once for each element in an array 
        array.map() creates a new array by performing a function on each array element. 
        array.every() checks if all array values pass a test 


        there are several different methods that were not mentioned due to them having specific functions as in array.reduce().  The 
        choice of an iterator depends of the purpose to iterate over the array.
