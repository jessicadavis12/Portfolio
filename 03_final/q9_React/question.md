When does React's Virtual DOM update the real DOM?

the virtual dom updates the real dom when the DOM is Rerendered 


## Feedback - 1/3 point

what we are really looking for is when there props or state change - this is what causes the re-rendering.
=======
### Feedback: 
re-rendering happens when the state or props have changed. React compares those before and after and if there is a difference it fires the render function.
